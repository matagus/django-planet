django-planet
=============

A Django app that provides everything you need to build planet feed aggregator website. 

**Notes**: `main` branch has been unmaintained for years but since February 2023 I've been making `some work in a new branch <https://github.com/matagus/django-planet/tree/upgrade-to-django4x-drop-python2-support-minimal-version>`_ in order to provide a simpler app (with less dependencies, better tests, and simplified packaging using `hatch <https://github.com/pypa/hatch>`_) and a working sample project with full features. I'm deplying `a demo website <https://django-planet.fly.dev/>`_ to Fly.io and keeping it updated. See some screenshots below. **Warning: this new branch is unstable and backwards incompatible!**
